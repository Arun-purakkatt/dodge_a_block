## Technical Details

### Architecture

The game is built using a modular architecture with the following key components:

- `Game`: Main game loop and state management
- `Player`: Player movement and controls
- `BlockManager`: Block spawning and management with object pooling
- `CollisionSystem`: Efficient collision detection using spatial partitioning
- `ScoreManager`: Score tracking and high score persistence
- `PerformanceMonitor`: Performance tracking and optimization

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Object Pooling**
   - Reuses block objects to reduce garbage collection
   - Automatically grows pool size as needed
   - Efficient memory management

2. **Spatial Partitioning**
   - Grid-based collision detection
   - Reduces collision checks to nearby objects
   - Scales well with many objects

3. **Rendering Optimizations**
   - Efficient canvas rendering
   - Minimal state changes
   - Smooth animations

4. **Memory Management**
   - Object reuse
   - Minimal allocations during gameplay
   - Automatic cleanup

### Statistics and Debugging

The game includes detailed statistics tracking:

- FPS and frame timing
- Memory usage
- Object counts
- Collision statistics
- Performance metrics

In development mode (NODE_ENV=development), debug information is displayed on screen.
